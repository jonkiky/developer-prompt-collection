Code to review:
```typescript
import { hash, compare } from 'bcrypt';
import { sign, verify } from 'jsonwebtoken';
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

export class AuthService {
  private readonly SALT_ROUNDS = 10;
  private readonly JWT_SECRET = process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'default-secret';

  async hashPassword(password: string): Promise<string> {
    return hash(password, this.SALT_ROUNDS);
  }

  async login(email: string, password: string): Promise<string | null> {
    const user = await this.userRepository.findByEmail(email);
    if (!user) return null;

    const isValid = await compare(password, user.passwordHash);
    if (!isValid) return null;

    return sign({ userId: user.id }, this.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '1h' });
  }

  async validateToken(token: string): Promise<any> {
    try {
      return verify(token, this.JWT_SECRET);
    } catch {
      return null;
    }
  }
