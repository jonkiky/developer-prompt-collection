## Tips for Better Regex Prompts

1. Always provide:
   - Example text to match
   - Example text to not match
   - Context where regex will be used
   - Performance requirements

2. Specify:
   - Programming language
   - Regex flavor/engine
   - Required flags
   - Capture group needs

3. Consider:
   - Performance implications
   - Maintainability needs
   - Edge cases
   - Error handling

4. Test cases:
   - Valid matches
   - Invalid matches
   - Edge cases
   - Special characters
