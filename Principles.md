# 🧠 Prompt Engineering Principles: How to Think When Writing a Prompt  
_A structured mindset for non-developers_

---

**• Begin with clarity on your goal**  
Ask yourself what kind of output you want. Are you looking for a list, a paragraph, a summary, an opinion, a script? Knowing the end goal helps shape everything that follows.

**• Imagine the AI as a role-player**  
Give it a persona to take on — like a chef, coach, teacher, or storyteller. This helps the model respond in the tone, voice, and mindset that suits your task.

**• Frame your request like you’re giving a task to a smart assistant**  
Write naturally, but with structure. For example: “Can you write a friendly, three-line thank-you message to a teacher?”

**• Include specific details to reduce ambiguity**  
The more the AI knows about your intent, the better. Instead of “help me plan a trip,” say “plan a 3-day trip to Boston focused on history and food, traveling with a 6-year-old.”

**• Show what good looks like**  
If you can include a short example or describe what kind of answer you're hoping for, it sets a pattern the AI can follow more easily.

**• Suggest the output format**  
Mention how you'd like the answer to look — such as “in bullet points,” “as a table,” or “in a casual tone with emojis.” It helps structure the result for quick use.

**• Break big tasks into smaller steps**  
Rather than asking for everything at once, guide the AI through a sequence. Start with brainstorming, then outline, then full content. This keeps the quality high and the output more manageable.

**• Treat the prompt as a living draft**  
If the response isn’t quite right, try changing one thing: the wording, the tone, the context. Prompting is about iteration — each change can improve the result.

**• Use constraints to focus the output**  
Think in terms of word count, style, or content limits — like “keep it under 100 words,” or “use simple, friendly language.” Constraints help the AI stay aligned with your needs.

**• Think of the AI as your creative collaborator**  
You’re not just giving orders — you’re co-creating. Be clear, guide it, and refine together. The best prompts feel like a conversation between you and a really smart assistant.
