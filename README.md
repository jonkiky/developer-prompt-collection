## 🧭 Prompt Writing Principles

This collection follows prompt engineering principles to maximize clarity, reliability, and usefulness:

- **Start with the outcome** – Prompts are designed with specific output goals
- **Assign a role to the AI** – e.g., “You are a senior backend engineer…”
- **Use constraints** – Limit scope, format output, or request structured responses
- **Show examples** – Few-shot prompts guide better completions
- **Break complex tasks into steps** – Chain of thought prompting where needed
- **Iterate and refine** – Prompts are tested and improved regularly
